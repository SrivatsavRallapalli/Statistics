                <p style="text-indent: 80px;"> Statistics is a branch of Mathematics which deals with the summary and analysis of the data in various
                    fields. Now-a-days it is useful in each and every place. The word statistics has different meanings.Some of them are given below:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The word Statistics comes from an Italian word called <q><em>Statista</em></q> which means "Statesman". The word Statistics is 
                    defined as follows:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Some define statistics as the collection, organising, analysis and representation of the data.</li>
                    <li> Some define it as the science of estimates and probability.</li>
                    <li> Statistics may be called the science of counting. </li>
                    <li> Statistics is the science of measurement of social organism, regarded as whole in all its manifestations.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p> The main aim of Statistics is analysing the data that is collected. It has several stages: </p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li> Collection of Data </li>
                    <li> Tabulation of Data </li>
                    <li> Analysing of Data </li> 
                    <li> Visualisation of Data </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p> The data that we have used is of two types namely <em>Primary Data</em> and <em>Secondary Data.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p> The scope of Statistics in this world is a large one. It took place in all the areas where people work. 
                    By this we can clearly say that without statistics there is no world. Some of the areas where statistics play an important
                role is given below: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Business </li>
                    <li> finance </li>
                    <li> Government </li>
                    <li> Medicine </li>
